# hello-world
This is my first repository. Or, at least, my first in a long while.

I have, in the past, considered exploring programming, coding, and other such fields. I backed away and attempted to make further use of my English degree by exploring fields I'm already qualified for: copywriting, legal work, and education. None of them worked out. And now I am back here, trying to make my way in the dizzyingly large field of Git, computer languages, syntax, functions, and data structures. All of it, of course, in the pursuit of creating beautiful and wonderful things.

May this initial repository serve as a solid start to a bright new future.
